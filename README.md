# webscrape_kickstarter
NYCDSA - Webscraping project

Scraped data from the crowd-funding site "kickstarter.com" for the top 100 projects (based on the "magic sort") in each of the 15 categories using Python and Selenium to analyse and answer some of the research questions such as:
- which categories of projects receive more funding?
- Do longer campaigns raise more money?
- Which categories of projects have more backers?
